                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    I’m currently a Full Stack Web Programmer at Green Mountain Software in Burlington, Vermont. I love writing great code. I love taming
                    technologies and explaining their usefulness.
                    <b class="bg-light-yellow">Most importantly, I love to help people.</b>
                </p>
                <h2 class="f3  f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Developing Software</h2>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    The past two years at a software development shop has given me great experience with a wide variety of
                    technologies. For recent projects, I’ve written: <br/><br>
                    a React.js frontend, <br />
                    Spring Boot restful APIs, <br />
                    a Ruby on Rails mobile gaming backend, and <br />
                    data pipelines powered by Apache Spark and MapReduce clusters. <br /><br />
                    Web apps have a lot of layers and I’ve worked on all of them. From an IT perspective, the AWS cloud is my
                    specialty.
                </p>
                <h2 class="f3 f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Maintenance and Optimization</h2>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    Along with writing software, I manage customer projects; each with their own architecture. <b class="bg-light-yellow">Debugging
                    hardware, software, and the systems they’re comprised of is part of my
                    daily routine. </b>A more fitting job description would be full-stack(s) web developer; they’re like snowflakes.
                    One stack in particular has been incredibly gratifying: <br /><br />
                    We were hired to build a data visualization dashboard for a large power transformer company,
                    <a class="pink" href="https://www.dynapower.com/">Dynapower</a>. The users needed graphs without any loss of
                    fidelity, but their raw data was too large for a browser to handle. What followed was a refactor of the data
                    collection stack. It now consists of distributed streaming data ingestion, Apache Spark processing using point
                    reduction algorithms, and a NoSQL database. The graphs look identical to raw data but they load in a fraction of
                    a second; I learned a ton.
                </p>
                <h2 class="f3 f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Support and Communication</h2>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    Unlike other developers, I am not head down writing code day in and day out. I spend a lot of time communicating
                    with our customers. I enjoy this part of my job very much; talking with people is a perfect complement to the
                    actual work I do for them. Our customers have a diverse range
                    of backgrounds (researchers, startups and small business owners) and knowing how to explain and educate to varying
                    levels of technical know-how is an incredibly refreshing exercise.
                </p>
                <p class="f3 f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure-narrow georgia">To me, empathy has a place in software development.</p>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">I find that communicating with customers is a puzzle, unsolvable
                    without the ability to put myself in their shoes. How much do they want to know? Do they want to fully grasp the
                    issue or just a quick fix? <b class="bg-light-yellow">Regardless, the end goal is simple and always the same: make our
                    customers happy.</b>
                </p>
                <h1 class="f3 f2-m f1-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Why Support?</h1>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    At Basecamp, I would thrive in a Support Programmer position. Saying <i>“That’s not my job,”</i> is not
                    interesting to me - my job is to make myself invaluable. If it means learning new things, great! If it means
                    doing things that aren’t my strong suit, I’d invite the opportunity to improve. If it involves deep mastery
                    of a single subject or focus, then consider me excited to rise the ranks. <b class="bg-light-yellow">My goal with everyone is to exceed
                    expectations and create <i>joy</i></b>.
                </p>
                <p class="f3 f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure-narrow georgia">
                    Having a passion for compassion, leaving people happy and going above and beyond is... me.
                </p>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    My experience debugging, supporting, building systems and communicating with customers primes me well for the
                    position - and with a little help, grow into something great.
                </p>
                <h1 class="f3 f2-m f1-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Why Basecamp?</h1>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    It's simple: the passion. It seems to spill from every blog post and product and employee that comes from Basecamp.
                    The constant questioning <i>"What is best for our customers and employees?"</i> is something I am committed to,
                    and want to be a part of. Basecamp strives to make the web a better place, to make technology easy,
                    to actually help people. <b class="bg-light-yellow">It’s a place I want to call home.</b>
                </p>
                <h1 class="f3 f2-m f1-ns lh-copy measure georgia ">Thanks</h1>
