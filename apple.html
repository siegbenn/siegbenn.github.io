                <h1 class="f3 f2-m f1-ns lh-copy measure georgia">What I Do</h1>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    I’m currently a Full Stack Web Programmer at Green Mountain Software in Burlington, Vermont. I love writing great code. I love taming
                    technologies and explaining their usefulness.
                    <strong class="bg-light-yellow">Most importantly, I love to help people.</strong>
                </p>
                <h2 class="f3  f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Developing Software</h2>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    The past two years at a software development shop has given me great experience with a wide variety of
                    technologies. For recent projects, I’ve written: <br/><br>
                    React.js frontends, <br />
                    Spring Boot restful APIs, and<br />
                    Dashboards + pipelines powered by Apache Spark and MapReduce clusters. <br /><br />
                    Web apps have a lot of layers and I’ve worked on all of them. From an IT perspective, the AWS cloud is my
                    specialty.
                </p>
                <h2 class="f3 f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Maintenance and Optimization</h2>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    Along with writing software, I manage customer projects; each with their own architecture. <strong class="bg-light-yellow">Debugging
                    hardware, software, and the systems they’re comprised of is part of my
                    daily routine. </strong>A more fitting job description would be full-stack(s) web developer; they’re like snowflakes.
                    One stack in particular has been incredibly gratifying: <br /><br />
                    We were hired to build a data visualization dashboard for a large power transformer company,
                    <a class="pink" href="https://www.dynapower.com/">Dynapower</a>. The users needed graphs without any loss of
                    fidelity, but their raw data was too large for a browser to handle. What followed was a refactor of the data
                    collection stack. It now consists of distributed streaming data ingestion, Apache Spark processing using point
                    reduction algorithms, and a NoSQL database. The graphs look identical to raw data but they load in a fraction of
                    a second; I learned a ton.
                </p>
                <h2 class="f3 f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Support and Communication</h2>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                    Unlike other developers, I am not head down writing code day in and day out. I spend a lot of time communicating
                    with our customers. I enjoy this part of my job very much; talking with people is a perfect complement to the
                    actual work I do for them. Our customers have a diverse range
                    of backgrounds (researchers, startups and small business owners) and knowing how to explain and educate to varying
                    levels of technical know-how is an incredibly refreshing exercise.
                </p>
                <p class="f3 f3-m f2-ns lh-copy measure-narrow georgia">To me, empathy has a place in software development.</p>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">I find that communicating with customers is a puzzle, unsolvable
                    without the ability to put myself in their shoes. How much do they want to know? Do they want to fully grasp the
                    issue or just a quick fix? <strong class="bg-light-yellow">Regardless, the end goal is simple and always the same: make our
                    customers happy.</strong>
                </p>
                <h1 class="f3 f2-m f1-ns lh-copy measure georgia">Why Apple?</h1>
                <p class="f5 f5-m f4-ns lh-copy measure georgia">

For my whole life I’ve used Apple. I remember drawing pictures on the Apple LC,  first browsing the internet on the iMac G3, and <em>my</em> first computer; the iMac Core Duo. Every iteration was better than the last. So, why Apple? It's simple: the passion. It seems to spill from every product and service. The constant questioning <em>"What is best for our customers? How can we make this better?"</em> is something I am committed to, and want to be a part of.
